        Text2Cypher Llama Agents

    <p>
        A collection of LlamaIndex Workflows-powered agents that convert natural language to Cypher queries designed to retrieve information from a Neo4j database to answer the question.

        <p>
        The naive text2cypher architecture is a streamlined approach to converting natural
        language questions into Cypher queries for Neo4j graph databases. It operates through a
        three-stage workflow: first, it generates a Cypher query from the input question using few-
        shot learning with similar examples stored in a vector database. The system then
        executes the generated Cypher query against the graph database. Finally, it processes
        the database results through a language model to generate a natural language response
        that directly answers the original question. This architecture maintains a simple yet
        effective pipeline, leveraging vector similarity search for example fewshot retrieval and
        LLM for both Cypher query generation and response formatting.

        <summary>Naive text2cypher with retry flow</summary>
        <p>
        This enhanced version of text2cypher with retry builds upon the original architecture by
        adding a self-correction mechanism. When a generated Cypher query fails to execute,
        instead of failing outright, the system attempts to fix the query by feeding the error
        information back to the language model in the CorrectCypherEventstep. This makes the
        system more resilient and capable of handling initial mistakes, similar to how a human
        might revise their approach after receiving error feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
        The ExecuteCypherEvent function first attempts to run the query, and if successful, passes the results
        forward for summarization. However, if something goes wrong, it doesn’t give up
        immediately — instead, it checks if it has any retry attempts left and, if so, sends the
        query back for correction along with information about what went wrong. This creates a
        more forgiving system that can learn from its mistakes, much like how we might revise
        our approach after receiving feedback.

        <summary>Naive text2cypher with retry and evaluation flow</summary>
        <p>
        Building on the naive text2cypher with retry flow, this enhanced version adds an
        evaluation phase that checks if the query results are sufficient to answer the user's
        question. If the results are deemed inadequate, the system sends the query back for
        correction with information on how to improve it. If the results are acceptable, the flow
        proceeds to the final summarization step. This extra layer of validation further bolsters the
        resilience of the pipeline, ensuring that the user ultimately receives the most accurate and
        complete answer possible.
        </p>
        <p>
        The function evaluate_check is a simple check that determines whether the query results
        adequately address the user's question. If the evaluation indicates the results are
        insufficient and there are retry attempts remaining, it returns a CorrectCypherEventso the
        query can be refined. Otherwise, it proceeds with a SummarizeEvent,indicating that the
        results are suitable for final summarization.

        <summary>Iterative planner flow</summary>
        <p>
        The iterative planner flow introduces a more sophisticated approach by implementing an
        iterative planning system. Instead of directly generating a Cypher query, it first creates a
        plan of sub-queries, validates each query before execution, and includes an information
        checking mechanism that can modify the plan if the initial results are insufficient. The
        system can make up to three iterations of information gathering, each time refining its
        approach based on previous results. This creates a more thorough and accurate
        question-answering system that can handle complex queries by breaking them down into
        manageable steps and validating the information at each stage.
